If your contract must store the response (or\n @dev anything derived from it) and use it later, you must ensure that any\n @dev user-significant behavior which depends on that stored value cannot be\n @dev manipulated by a subsequent VRF request.\n @dev Similarly, both miners and the VRF oracle itself have some influence\n @dev over the order in which VRF responses appear on the blockchain, so if\n @dev your contract could have multiple VRF requests in flight simultaneously,\n @dev you must ensure that the order in which the VRF responses arrive cannot\n @dev be used to manipulate your contract's user-significant behavior.\n @dev Since the block hash of the block which contains the requestRandomness\n @dev call is mixed into the input to the VRF *last*, a sufficiently powerful\n @dev miner could, in principle, fork the blockchain to evict the block\n @dev containing the request, forcing the request to be included in a\n @dev different block with a different hash, and therefore a different input\n @dev to the VRF. However, such an attack would incur a substantial economic\n @dev cost. This cost scales with the number of blocks the VRF oracle waits\n @dev until it calls responds to a request. It is for this reason that\n @dev that you can signal to an oracle you'd like them to wait longer before\n @dev responding to the request (however this is not enforced in the contract\n @dev and so remains effective only in the case of unmodified oracle software)."},"fullyImplemented":false,"id":96,"linearizedBaseContracts":[96],"name":"VRFConsumerBaseV2","nameLocation":"5351:17:2","nodeType":"ContractDefinition","nodes":[{"id":47,"name":"OnlyCoordinatorCanFulfill","nameLocation":"5379:25:2","nodeType":"ErrorDefinition","parameters":{"id":46,"nodeType":"ParameterList","parameters":[{"constant":false,"id":43,"mutability":"mutable","name":"have","nameLocation":"5413:4:2","nodeType":"VariableDeclaration","scope":47,"src":"5405:12:2","stateVariable":false,"storageLocation":"default","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_address","typeString":"address"},"typeName":{"id":42,"name":"address","nodeType":"ElementaryTypeName","src":"5405:7:2","stateMutability":"nonpayable","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_address","typeString":"address"}},"visibility":"internal"},{"constant":false,"id":45,"mutability":"mutable","name":"want","nameLocation":"5427:4:2","nodeType":"VariableDeclaration","scope":47,"src":"5419:12:2","stateVariable":false,"storageLocation":"default","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_address","typeString":"address"},"typeName":{"id":44,"name":"address","nodeType":"ElementaryTypeName","src":"5419:7:2","stateMutability":"nonpayable","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_address","typeString":"address"}},"visibility":"internal"}],"src":"5404:28:2"},"src":"5373:60:2"},{"constant":false,"id":49,"mutability":"immutable","name":"vrfCoordinator","nameLocation":"5462:14:2","nodeType":"VariableDeclaration","scope":96,"src":"5436:40:2","stateVariable":true,"storageLocation":"default","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_address","typeString":"address"},"typeName":{"id":48,"name":"address","nodeType":"ElementaryTypeName","src":"5436:7:2","stateMutability":"nonpayable","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_address","typeString":"address"}},"visibility":"private"},{"body":{"id":59,"nodeType":"Block","src":"5593:43:2","statements":[{"expression":{"id":57,"isConstant":false,"isLValue":false,"isPure":false,"lValueRequested":false,"leftHandSide":{"id":55,"name":"vrfCoordinator","nodeType":"Identifier","overloadedDeclarations":[],"referencedDeclaration":49,"src":"5599:14:2","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_address","typeString":"address"}},"nodeType":"Assignment","operator":"=","rightHandSide":{"id":56,"name":"_vrfCoordinator","nodeType":"Identifier","overloadedDeclarations":[],"referencedDeclaration":52,"src":"5616:15:2","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_address","typeString":"address"}},"src":"5599:32:2","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_address","typeString":"address"}},"id":58,"nodeType":"ExpressionStatement","src":"5599:32:2"}]},"documentation":{"id":50,"nodeType":"StructuredDocumentation","src":"5481:72:2","text":" @param _vrfCoordinator address of VRFCoordinator contract"},"id":60,"implemented":true,"kind":"constructor","modifiers":[],"name":"","nameLocation":"-1:-1:-1","nodeType":"FunctionDefinition","parameters":{"id":53,"nodeType":"ParameterList","parameters":[{"constant":false,"id":52,"mutability":"mutable","name":"_vrfCoordinator","nameLocation":"5576:15:2","nodeType":"VariableDeclaration","scope":60,"src":"5568:23:2","stateVariable":false,"storageLocation":"default","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_address","typeString":"address"},"typeName":{"id":51,"name":"address","nodeType":"ElementaryTypeName","src":"5568:7:2","stateMutability":"nonpayable","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_address","typeString":"address"}},"visibility":"internal"}],"src":"5567:25:2"},"returnParameters":{"id":54,"nodeType":"ParameterList","parameters":[],"src":"5593:0:2"},"scope":96,"src":"5556:80:2","stateMutability":"nonpayable","virtual":false,"visibility":"internal"},{"documentation":{"id":61,"nodeType":"StructuredDocumentation","src":"5640:686:2","text":" @notice fulfillRandomness handles the VRF response.
